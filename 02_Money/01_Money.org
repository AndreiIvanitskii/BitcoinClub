* History of Money
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Note
#+END_NOTES
* Prehistory â€” Barter
*Direct exchange* of good or services without using a /medium of exchange/ (such as money).
Limitations
  - difficult to find a match (does not scale)
  - not always feasible (how many apples for a horse?)
  - no common measure of value
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Barter uses to work in ancient societies when the number of different goods or services were low.
Lack of common measure of value makes difficult to make economic calculations.
#+END_NOTES

* Primitive Money
** Cowrie Shells
The most scarcest and hardest to find.
** Alternative
** Problems With Primitive Money
They are not universal.
When people from forest met people from cost lines economics could collapse.

* Commodity Money
** Grains
Pros
  - scarce
  - fairly easy to transport
  - *divisible*
  - *more universal than seashells*
Cons
  - not really universal (differ in quality, size, type)
  - not easy to store
** Gold
Pros
  - really scarce
  - universal
  - divisible
  - easy to transport
  - *easy to store*
Cons
  - not easy to verify
  - not divisible enough
** Silver, Copper
That is why *Silver* and *Copper* arose.
*Not* because they are good money, but because *gold* was not good enough.

* Representative Money
A medium of exchange that represents something of value, but has little or no value of its own.
Pros
  - scarce (as value they represent)
  - universal (as value they represent)
  - divisible
  - easy to transport
  - easy to store
  - *easy to verify*

** What is Wrong with Representative Money?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
*Trust*
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
As any promise it will be broken...
#+BEGIN_NOTES
 - We have to trust (a bank, a government) to keep the promise to exchange the money for the value they represent.
 - It happened many times in the human history.
 - The most recent and the most notable is ending of the Gold standard in the US.
