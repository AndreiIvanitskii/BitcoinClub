* History of Money
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Bitcoin is Money.
#+END_NOTES

* Prehistory — Barter
*Direct exchange* of good or services without using a /medium of exchange/ (such as money)
** Limitations
   - Difficult to find a match (does not scale)
   - Not always feasible (how many apples for a horse?)
   - No common measure of value
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Why do we need money at the first place?
Barter uses to work in ancient societies when the number of different goods or services were low.
Lack of common measure of value makes difficult to make economic calculations.
#+END_NOTES

* Primitive Money
** Cowrie Shells
[[../ext/wikimedia/cowrie-shells.jpg]]
#+BEGIN_NOTES
The most scarcest and hardest to find.
#+END_NOTES

** Problems With Primitive Money
They are not *universal*, nor *scarce*
#+BEGIN_NOTES
 - shells were used in Pacific Islands, but Aggry beads were used in Africa
 - when colonists came with advanced technologies, such money felt hard
#+END_NOTES

* Commodity Money
** Grains
[[../imgs/grains.jpg]]
*** Pros
    - Scarce
    - Fairly easy to transport
    - Divisible
    - *More universal* (than seashells)
*** Cons
    - Not really universal (differ in quality, size, type)
    - Not easy to store
** Gold
[[../imgs/gold.jpg]]
*** Pros
    - Really scarce
    - Universal
    - Divisible
    - Easy to transport
    - *Easy to store*
*** Cons
    - Not easy to verify
    - Not divisible enough
*** Silver, Copper as Commodity Money?
Note: *Silver* and *Copper* arose not because they were good money, but because *gold* was not good enough

* Representative Money
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
A medium of exchange that represents something of value, but has little or no value of its own
** Pros
   - Scarce (as value they represent)
   - Universal (as value they represent)
   - Divisible
   - Easy to transport
   - Easy to store
   - *Easy to verify*
#+BEGIN_NOTES
 - easy to verify since they are designed to be difficult to counterfeit, bit easy to verify
#+END_NOTES

** What is Wrong with Representative Money?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
*Trust*
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
As any promise it will be broken...
#+BEGIN_NOTES
 - We have to trust (a bank, a government) to keep the promise to exchange the money for the value they represent.
 - It happened many times in the human history.
 - The most recent and the most notable is ending of the Gold standard in the US.
#+END_NOTES

* Fiat Money
A currency established as money, often by government regulation, but that has no intrinsic value
[[../imgs/50-usd-note.jpg]]

** Problems With Fiat Money
Government has *power* to debase it. Unpredictably.\\
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
As any power it will be abused...

** History of Reserve Currencies
[[../ext/other/reserve-currencies.png]]

* Bitcoin
  - Pure digital currency
  - Limited predictable supply (21 million)
  - No single entity in charge
#+BEGIN_NOTES
 - divisible, easy to transport, easy to store
#+END_NOTES

* Good Money Properties
  - Scarce
  - Divisible
  - Easy to transport
  - Easy to store
  - Easy to verify
  - Trustless
  - No single entity in charge
