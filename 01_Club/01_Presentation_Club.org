  - *Why?*
    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
    I want to live in the world where people have /control/ over and /responsibility/ for what they value
  - *How?*

    Educate people how to possess and operate with bitcoin /securely/ and /privately/
  - *What?*
    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
    The club
#+BEGIN_NOTES
If people have control, they naturally grow responsibilities.
It will result in a safer, healthier, happier and better world.

You in control what information you share and with whom.
Do not expect that a government agency will educate you or your kids will be taught it in school.
That is not what they will give us, but what we have to take ourselves.

I will provide information, give advice. The first point of contact regarding related questions.
